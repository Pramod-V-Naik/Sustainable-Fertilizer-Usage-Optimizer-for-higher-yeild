# Sustainable-Fertilizer-Usage-Optimizer-for-Higher-Yeild
Agriculture plays a crucial role in ensuring global food security and economic stability. However, improper fertilizer usage remains a persistent challenge, leading to soil degradation, reduced crop productivity, and financial losses for farmers. Traditional fertilizer application methods rely on guesswork and experience, often resulting in inefficient nutrient management. To address this issue, the Sustainable Fertilizer Usage Optimizer is developed as a smart recommendation system that leverages machine learning (ML) to provide accurate and data-driven fertilizer suggestions based on real-time soil conditions. The system collects key soil parameters such as Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), pH level, moisture content, and organic matter, which are processed using Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. This enables precise fertilizer recommendations that optimize soil health while ensuring sustainability.
